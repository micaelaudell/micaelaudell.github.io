	<h3>FAVORITE BREAKFAST</h3>
	<p> I love to make avocado toast. My favorite is sour bread toast with avocado mashed with lemon, feta cheese and balsamic on top. I also love dipping it in hot sauce on the side!</p>

	<h1>FAVORITE LUNCH</h1>
	<P> My favorite food for lunch is usually grilled cheese. It’s the best kid food that I eat all the time. I also always 	dip it in ketchup, even though most people hate the taste of that.</P>

	<h1>FAVORITE DINNER</h1>
	<P> My favorite dinner food is penne alle vodka. My favorite recipe is from famous model Gigi Hadid. I always make this for dinner at home, it’s super easy and delicious!</P>

	<h1>FAVORITE DESSERT</h1>
	<P> My favorite desert would definitely be a Nutella crepe. I have my own homemade recipe that I make all the time. I sometimes like to add strawberries too.</P>

<article>
	<h1>FAVORITE SNACK</h1>
	<P> My favorite snack is Extra Cheddar Goldfish. I prefer this flavor over the regular one because it is tastes more like cheese. It may be messy with the crumbs, but it is tasty!</P>

	<h1>FAVORITE SMOOTHIE</h1>
	<P> My favorite smoothie is strawberry banana. I also sometimes like blackberries and raspberries too, but I prefer to have just strawberries and bananas. It is sweet and healthy! </P>
